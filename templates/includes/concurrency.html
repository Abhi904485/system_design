<p class="mt-4"><strong>How to handle concurrency; such that no two users are able to book the same seat?</strong>We can use transactions in SQL databases to avoid any clashes. For example, if we are using SQL server we can utilize Transaction Isolation Levels to lock the rows before we update them. Note: within a transaction, if we read rows we get a write-lock on them so that they can’t be updated by anyone else. Here is the sample code:</p>

<div class="border border-info" style="background-color: #1e1e1e; border-radius: 0px;">
    <pre id="{{forloop.counter}}" class="ml-3 mt-1" style="color: azure;">
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    -- Suppose we intend to reserve three seats (IDs: 54, 55, 56) for ShowID=99 
    Select * From ShowSeat where ShowID=99 && ShowSeatID in (54, 55, 56) && isReserved=0 

    -- if the number of rows returned by the above statement is NOT three, we can return failure to the user.
    update ShowSeat table...
    update Booking table ...
COMMIT TRANSACTION;
    </pre>
</div>
<p>Serializable is the highest isolation level and guarantees safety from Dirty, Nonrepeatable, and Phantoms reads.</p>

<p>Once the above database transaction is successful, we can safely assume that the reservation has been marked successfully and no two customers will be able to reserve the same seat.</p>

<p>Here is the sample Java code:</p>

<div class="border border-info">
    <pre class="ml-3 mt-1">
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.sql.ResultSet;

public class Customer extends Person {

    public boolean makeBooking(Booking booking) {
    List<ShowSeat> seats = booking.getSeats();
    Integer seatIds[] = new Integer[seats.size()];
    int index = 0;
    for(ShowSeat seat : seats) {
        seatIds[index++] = seat.getShowSeatId();
    }

    Connection dbConnection = null;
    try {
        dbConnection = getDBConnection();
        dbConnection.setAutoCommit(false);
        // ‘Serializable’ is the highest isolation level and guarantees safety from
        // Dirty, Nonrepeatable, and Phantoms reads
        dbConnection.setTransactionIsolation(Connection.TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE);

        Statement st = dbConnection.createStatement();
        String selectSQL = "Select * From ShowSeat where ShowID=? && ShowSeatID in (?) && isReserved=0";
        PreparedStatement preparedStatement = dbConnection.prepareStatement(selectSQL);
        preparedStatement.setInt(1, booking.getShow().getShowId());
        Array array = dbConnection.createArrayOf("INTEGER", seatIds);
        preparedStatement.setArray(2, array);

        ResultSet rs = preparedStatement.executeQuery();
        // With TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE all the read rows will have the write lock, so we can
        // safely assume that no one else is modifying them.
        if (rs.next()) {
        rs.last(); // move to the last row, to calculate the row count
        int rowCount = rs.getRow();
        // check if we have expected number of rows, if not, this means another process is
        // trying to process at least one of the same row, if that is the case we
        // should not process this booking.
        if(rowCount == seats.size()) {
            // update ShowSeat table...
            // update Booking table ...
            dbConnection.commit();
            return true;
        }
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        dbConnection.rollback();
        System.out.println(e.getMessage());
    }
    return false;
    }
}
    </pre>
